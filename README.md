IssueTracker

Originally an project on sourceforge [issue-tracker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/issue-tracker)

Issue-Tracker is a support issue tracking system written in PHP, with option of either a PostgreSQL of MySQL backend. 
The system is designed to be user friendly, and uses a simple modular API to make addition of new modules or features 
very easy.

Issue-Tracker also includes many features that will allow customer/technical support organizations to take care of 
customer issues quickly and easy. Some of these features include things like file uploads, email parsing, email and 
sms notifications, unlimited users and groups, and much more.

This is an attempt to rewrite the system in yii2 and composer.  Currently not there yet.
